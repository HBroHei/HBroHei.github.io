        <h1>NSMBW Custom level</h1>
        Here you will find a lost of custom
        New Super Mario Bros Wii stages made by me with the Reggie! Level editor.
        All files are in .arc format. To play them,
        rename the file to "01-01.arc", and replace the one in the "Stage" folder
        of the game.<br>
        For more information on how to play these levels, search up "NSMBW import custom levels".

                    This level wouldn't get many plays anyways.
